# Description
#     Setup for ADIOS include/libraries (usually ThirdParty installation).
#
#     To disable its use:               adios1_version=adios-none
#     For system-wide installations:    adios1_version=adios-system
#
#     For central installations not located under ThirdParty:
#       1. use adios-system
#       2. and provide full path for ADIOS1_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     Changes made here MUST be made in the equivalent config.sh version too,
#     since that is the one used in the build process.
#     See further notes there.
#
#     Can also disable by renaming/removing this file or by creating an empty
#     file with the same name at a user or site location.

# USER EDITABLE PART: Changes made here may be lost with the next upgrade
